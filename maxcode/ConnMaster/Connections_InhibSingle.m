function C = Connections_InhibSingle()

%{
    This program will determine the connectivity between a single pair of
    inhibitory neurons.  This connection will follow Rieubland et al 2014 
    using the 'non-uniform random' model.  Connectivity for electric or
    chemical synapses will depend soley on the distances in the z and xy
    planes.

    INPUT

    Dz = Distance in z direction between two neurons
    Dxy = Distance between neurons in xy plane
    con = Electrical or chemical connection

    OUTPUT

    C = connected or not?
