function [C, c] = CreateConnectivityMatrix(connStruct, choice)

%{
    This program will determine the intersomatic distances between neurons
    in the network using periodic boundary conditions, assuming isotropic
    connectivity.

    INPUT
    
    connStruct = Connectivity structure with several fields determining
    types of connectivity networks
    typeConn = Type of connection for this subset of network
        1 = Random 
        2 = Exponential decay x
        3 = Nearest neighbor
        4 = Threshold 
        5 = Chemical inhib
        6 = Electrical inhib
        7 = Common neighbor
        8 = Microcolumnar 
        9 = Blank
        choice = Defining whether we care about EE, EI, IE or II connections
        1 = EE
        2 = EI
        3 = IE
        4 = II

    OUTPUT
