function connStruct = CreateConnectivityStructure()

%{
    This program will be used to initialize the most important structure
    for the Master Connectivity code - the connectivity structure, connStruct.  
    This structure will contain in a simple way all the basic information
    for the types of networks that are desired.

    INPUT

    {}

    OUTPUT

    connStruct : Connectivity structure with several fields determining
    types of connectivity networks...
