        ===========
        
        What is it
        ----------
        
        NeuronVisio is a Graphical User Interface for `NEURON simulator enviroment 
        <http://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/>`_. 
        NeuronVisio connect with NEURON using the new python NEURON interface.
        
        Features
        --------
        
        - 3D visualization of the model with the possibility to change it runtime
        - Creation of vectors to record any variables present in the section 
        - Pylab integration to plot directly the result of the simulation
        - Exploration of the timecourse of any variable among time using a color 
        coded scale
        - the GUI runs in its own thread so it's possible to use the console 
        (strongly suggested to run through ipython)

        Move in the doc directory::
            
            cd doc
            
        and then launch::
